## *Welcome to (Gipsi's) GitHub Pages

For this round of 100Daysof code I started making a new website - I plan to do something each day with what I've learnt so far and as I learn new things. 
I'm curious about what it will become! [Up to Code](https://gipsi.neocities.org/)

### 16/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 7

After exploring some of the other websites at neocities I saw a [free comments box](https:/.www.freecommentscript.com/) script and had a play with that, trying to figure out whether and what type of HTML tag it should go inside. After reading this blogpost on [Accessibility Landmarks](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html) with this [demo](https://scottaohara.github.io/landmarks_demo/) page by Scott O'Hara I used a form tag.  

Added some titles to the buttons so a another box comes up to say what they are on hover.

Played a bit with [p5.js Web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) in Firefox browser.

Went down a rabbit hole of what the rss button does - and found Firefox is removing it December 2018.

### 15/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 6

Updated my new website project with a CSS animated [moon button](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/GYOQNY) coded by Chris Coyier.  I tried it out with the version I keep on desktop before uploading to neocities.  Also read a some of Rune Madsen's [Programming Design Systems](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/) and [Hello Processing](https://hello.processing.org/) Hour of Code.

### 14/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 5

I added some CSS to my new neocities website.  [Ground floor](https://groundfloor.neocities.org/text.html) - out-of-the-box styling framework. Reading [The Inner Light Theory of Consciousness: A scientific look at the human mind](http://www.dspguide.com/InnerLightTheory/Main.htm) by Steven W. Smith

### 13/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 4

My own new [#neocities website](https://neocities.org/site/gipsi) (one hour on an ipad) https://gipsi.neocities.org

### 12/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 3 
I made an ASCII alpaca with an Android app called [ASCII Cam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.darkside.asciicamfree&hl=en_GB).

### 10/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 2

Creative coding for audio visuals.  Lots of exploring, courses and tutorials for Puredata [Dan Wilcox robotcowboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5jE2V5i718&index=2&list=PLFDAFB17FB40E8161) TidalCycles [Yaxu](https://yaxu.org/) Sonic Pi [Sam Aaron](https://sonic-pi.net/).

[Digital sound processing tutorial for the brain dead](http://yehar.com/blog/?p=121)

###  09/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 1
Hacktoberfest: open source [My 6 contributions](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/gipsi)
Looked at quite a few repos to see what might be useful.  Yesterday I went through about 8 Hugo blog tutorials thinking Of contributing to a website, then decided that was a bit ambitious. So stuck to things I understand.  Like typos, spelling and whitespace.  My confidence in reading and understanding what code is is growing quicker than the writing of it.

## *Welcome to (Gipsi's) GitHub Pages
 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

I took summer break when I got to halfway through round 5 day 50ish of coding every day and have been focussing on making art.  Digital images with an Android phone camera, photo editor, Pixl andr Pixabay through May and June and watercolour painting in July.  I post the stuff I do on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gipsitana/).

## CNC2018 Code More

I've been structuring the way I think about coding, planning a website with the second CodeNewbie challenge this year.
I've started a plan with an html document in Notepad++.  Yesterday I started learning Trello boards.

> "The hardest part of coding more isn’t the coding — it’s finding a system and structure that fits into your busy life. We’ll help you set goals, create a roadmap, find a schedule, and, most importantly, hold you accountable to reaching your coding goals."

## One million women to tech - DIY track

I missed the onboarding during a sultry heatwave world cup weekend but managed to navigate through Facebook groups, Twitter, Youtube and emails to watch a replay of the webinar.  Inspired I caught up with the first weeks lessons by Tuesday night and so here I am Wednesday afternoon feeling chuffed at getting Python to do a calculation on my laptop in Powershell!

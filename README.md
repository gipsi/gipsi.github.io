### Day 17 - The Hill We Climb - #100daysofCode

Among other things I read a poem on CodePen ..

> When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid
> The new dawn blooms as we free it 
> For there is always light, 
> if only we're brave enough to see it 
> If only we're brave enough to be it
> - Amanda Gorman

### Day 16 - Semantic markup - #100DaysofCode

Separate content from style for meaning, structure and automated processing.

On current project updated all the `<i>`tags to `<em>` and all the 
`<b>` tags to `<strong>`.  And validated.

[Using `<b>` and `<i>` elements](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-b-and-i-tags)

### Feb 15
### Day 15 - HTML5 semantic elements - #100DaysofCode

### Feb 14
### Day 14 - Aesthetic programming - #100DaysOfCode 

> "A handbook of sorts, but [..] something more messy and at the same time more "useful" we would say: a book about the  more complex and deeply entangled set of relations between writing, coding and thinking."

> "The argument the book follows is that computational culture is not just a trendy topic to study to improve problem-solving and analytical skills, or a way to understand more about what is happening with computational processes, but is a means to engage with programming to question existing technological paradigms and further create changes in the technical system. We therefore consider programming to be a dynamic cultural practice and phenomenon, a way of thinking and doing in the world, and a means of understanding some of the complex procedures that underwrite and constitute our lived realities, in order to act upon those realities."

### Day 12 - Boolean attributes - R5 #100DaysofCode

According to the HTML specification:

The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the “true” value, and the absence of the attribute represents the “false” value.

Yet note:

The values “true” and “false” are not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted altogether.

### Day 7 - Character encoding - R5 #100DaysofCode

It is not enough to simply declare your encoding at the top of the web page. You have to ensure that your editor saves the file in UTF-8 also. 

If a browser is unable to detect the character encoding used in a page, the content may be unreadable.

What is encoding? [W3c](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding)

### How this site works
 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview content for the website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.

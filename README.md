You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## #100daysofCode R5D5
## #1mwtt #SummerofCode  D5

Carefuly went through what I learned in this weeks lessons and wrote some python code:
```
  name1 = input('Enter your first name: ')
  name2 = input('Enter your middle name: ')
  name3 = input('Enter your last name: ')
  print('Hello', name1 + ' ' + name2 + ' ' + name3)
```
```
  bestnumber = input('Enter your favourite number: ')
  print('Perhaps a better number is?', int(bestnumber) + 1)
```
Started using the interpreter ```>>>``` as well as ```print()``` from file

I took summer break when I got to halfway through round 5 day 50ish of coding every day and have been focussing on making art.  Digital images with an Android phone camera, photo editor, Pixl andr Pixabay through May and June and watercolour painting in July.  I post the stuff I do on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gipsitana/).

## CNC2018 Code More

I've been structuring the way I think about coding, planning a website with the second CodeNewbie challenge this year.
I've started a plan with an html document in Notepad++.  Yesterday I started learning Trello boards.

> "The hardest part of coding more isn’t the coding — it’s finding a system and structure that fits into your busy life. We’ll help you set goals, create a roadmap, find a schedule, and, most importantly, hold you accountable to reaching your coding goals."

## One million women to tech - DIY track

I missed the onboarding during a sultry heatwave World Cup weekend but managed to navigate through Facebook groups, Twitter, Youtube and emails to watch a replay of the webinar.  Inspired I caught up with the first weeks lessons by Tuesday night. So here I am Wednesday afternoon feeling chuffed at getting Python to do a calculation on my laptop in Powershell!  

![python](media/powershell.jpg)

The transcript of the lessons here on GitHub is great but I did get stuck when python wasn't recognised in Powershell or the Windows basic command prompt.  After some unfruitful Python help pages and stackoverflow searching I skipped ahead to [Learn Python the HardWay](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/ex0.html) which I know has thorough installation guide for newbs. Indeed I had to uninstall and start again, this time checking the PATH box which I'd left unchecked. Cool! Python was summoned in the shell. However my calc.py file still didn't work. This time the [Python FAQ's](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html) helped and I sorted out the file address.  I moved the py-programs and web-projects folders from the desktop to the users folder and cd'd to py-programs.

Note! The prompt ruby is a nice little tip about lessons origins of [Learn to program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) adapted for Python from Ruby.

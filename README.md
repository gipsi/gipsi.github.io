## 08 03 2022 ~ Tuesday
Proceeding to set up an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) site. Started: 14:00 UK winter time.
By 18:40 the shiny new site said Hi! Browsersync serving the index.html file and README.md from: _site. Woohoo localhost:8080! The command line instuction to make the html file hadn't worked kept giving '< was unexpected at this time' error, so made the file in VS code in the browser instead.
Rest of the evening figuring what to do next.. perused lots of [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/), reasons for using a [styleguide](https://www.zachleat.com/web/now-with-style-guide/), and a [poem](https://www.tatianamac.com/poetry/call-of-crows/).

And then, some [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

Found an online book and read some reminders of reasons to Learn JavaScript [w3docs](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-javascript.html)

" There are at least three perfect things about JavaScript:

1. It supports complete integration with CSS and HTML.
2. It provides straightforward ways of doing simple things.
3. It is supported by almost all the major browsers and is performed by default. "

# Welcome to GitHub Pages

<!--
> "The amateur software engineer is always in search of magic." - Grady Booch
> via Programming Wisdom @CodeWisdom on Twitter 12:37 PM - 12 Oct 2018 
-->

### How this site works

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview content for the website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we‚Äôll help you sort it out.

### June 22nd 2021 
### Day 36 - A bit of Git - #100DaysOfCode 

A deeper dive and rummage into  Git concepts prompted by this thread ...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most important GIT CONCEPTS <br><br>Stop copy-pasting, start Understanding <br><br>- THREAD -</p>&mdash; Iren Gataullina (@IrenSayWhen) <a href="https://twitter.com/IrenSayWhen/status/1404427336909471744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### June 21st 2021  
### Day 35 - HTML challenge - #100DaysofCode

Had a second try at this challenge using lots of < abbr> and < dfn> tags.  
Rather more than would usually be neccessary as clarified by helpful feedback from Jen Kramer:  
> < abbr> is for abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms. Let's say we're talking about HTML. All the <abbr> element tells us is what HTML stands for:

> < abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML< /abbr>

> < dfn> does the definition. Often that goes beyond the abbreviation (hopefully!):

>  < p>< dfn id="html">< abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML< /abbr>, the Hypertext Markup Language,</dfn> describes the structure of web documents, identifying parts of the document like headings, lists, and links.< /p>

> < p>However, < a href="#html">HTML< /a> is limited in its appearance and functionality.< /p>

> So here we've defined HTML early in the document. Later, if we want to refer to the definition, we link to it.

> Should we put a <abbr> around that second instance of HTML?... it depends. If we were pages into a book and we'd not used HTML in that time, perhaps so. If we're a paragraph later, probably not.

> So -- should people be defined? Maybe, but probably not in the sense of a dictionary entry. I love your link to Michelle Obama's Wikipedia entry, for example. If you don't know who she is, you can read about her. But that's just a plain old link. You can't look her up in Webster's dictionary. üòÅ

This has been a very useful exercise and lesson in how much and how flexibly text can be enriched with HTML.

### How this site works

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview content for the website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gipsi/gipsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Hacktoberfest: open source [My 6 contributions](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/gipsi)
Looked at quite a few repos to see what might be useful.  Yesterday I went through about 8 Hugo blog tutorials thinking Of contributing to a website, then decided that was a bit ambitious. So stuck to things I understand.  Like typos, spelling and whitespace.  My confidence in reading and understanding what code is is growing quicker than the writing of it.

#### Weekly review

This Summer of Code is covering a lot of ground and I have to decide what not to do to keep up.  The hot weather came back on Monday and my brain doesn't feel up to thinking and focusing so although I've tinkered a little every day I reserved most of the 'homework' for the weekend.  

Walking is more comfortable than sitting still on the hottest days and it was good to go to the seaside and watch a great barge full of rock arrive from Cornwall.  Seagulls and children splashing in waves swooshing through pebbles, the chug of a fishing boat and the squeal of fairground riders, a cool salt breeze soundscape.

Watching the video lectures and thinking about it works well for me then going back and doing the code.  I have to stop the videos till I get everything to work and although I still haven't finished day 1 of week 3 it feels like a breakthrough in 'getting it'.

I like to watch the tutorial videos and absorbing the concepts before coding along.  This weekend particularly I found that
getting setup and ready with the tools makes it easier to focus on the code.

## Install Fest weekend

### Pip, Jupyter notebook and NLTK

Sunday 29th July, 2018

#### The weather

I started this install fest on Friday as 50 days of heatwave finally broke down with  [mammatus](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/30484/why-is-the-mammatus-cloud-formation-so-dangerous) storm clouds blanketing the sky and effectively concealing the [lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2018_lunar_eclipse). The eclipse occurred simultaneously with the [perihelic opposition of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_Mars#Oppositions), a coincidence that happens once every 25,000 years.

Now (by Sunday lunchtime) it's raining steadily on a cool Atlantic wind, trees are flinging great drips against the windows and noisy magpies sound annoyed.

#### Modules and packages

How to access code that you saved in other files.

[Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage)


#### The Install Fest

##### Tab proliferation - Me too!

Ilona Budapesti's remark sums up well the theme of this weekend [#SummerOfCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5siljHaRF64) project.

- ```pip	``` [pip installs packages](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) natural language toolkit

I opened so many tabs getting this lot to work, learning much about  navigation, deciphering errors whilst trying to keep things light and simple.  When given the choice I decided to go with the ```pip``` installation route for the Jupyter notebook rather than downloading Anaconda.  This means I payed more attention to file paths which is something I'm still keeping an eye on and indeed there were some issues when trying to access NLTK in Jupyter.   Lots of practice with the command line - terminal - bash - shell - prompt, watching videos confirms it's not just me who cant decide what to call it.

# the "Hello World" of programming paradigms
```
### 99 bottles in computer science

> The [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist) [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) proved that the song has a [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) of                         O         (         log         ⁡         N         )                 {\displaystyle O(\log N)}    ![O(\log N)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/14eea297b4387decf341763c39dc038e05744272) in his [in-joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-joke)-article "[The Complexity of Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complexity_of_Songs)". 

> Numerous computer programs exist to output the lyrics to the song. This is analogous to ["Hello, World!" programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), with the addition of a [loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops).  As with "Hello World!", this can be a practice exercise for those  studying computer programming, and a demonstration of different [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) dealing with looping constructs and syntactic differences between programming languages within a paradigm.

# More Loops .
## #100daysofCode R5D8/9
## #1mwtt #SummerofCode D8/9 
Caught up with the SOC video lectures, Friday's one was a surprise and very uplifting.
Not much time left to code but I did do some tinkering with a while loop, quotes and escape character.

Watched the SOC replay for yesterday then updated the GitHub ToolKitten fork and went back to Day four lecture to follow along with the loop and while loop and break statement coding.  I lost some code in the editor, not sure how and after following along with the no copy pasting rule it feels like I'm going slow.  Still nothing seems to work first time.  I have to check and check again.  I even got into an infinite loop of zeros in the shell which flustered me a bit but the computer didn't blow up, I exited the shell with the x in the top right corner, rebooted python and everything was fine again.

  name1 = input('Enter your first name: ')
  name2 = input('Enter your middle name: ')
  name3 = input('Enter your last name: ')
  print('Hello', name1 + ' ' + name2 + ' ' + name3)

  bestnumber = input('Enter your favourite number: ')
  print('Perhaps a better number is?', int(bestnumber) + 1)

## CNC2018 Code More

I've been structuring the way I think about coding, planning a website with the second CodeNewbie challenge this year.
I've started a plan with an html document in Notepad++.  Yesterday I started learning Trello boards.

## One million women to tech - DIY track

I missed the onboarding during a sultry heatwave World Cup weekend but managed to navigate through Facebook groups, Twitter, Youtube and emails to watch a replay of the webinar.  Inspired I caught up with the first weeks lessons by Tuesday night. So here I am Wednesday afternoon feeling chuffed at getting Python to do a calculation on my laptop in Powershell!  

![python](media/powershell.jpg)

The transcript of the lessons here on GitHub is great but I did get stuck when python wasn't recognised in Powershell or the Windows basic command prompt.  After some unfruitful Python help pages and stackoverflow searching I skipped ahead to [Learn Python the HardWay](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/ex0.html) which I know has thorough installation guide for newbs. Indeed I had to uninstall and start again, this time checking the PATH box which I'd left unchecked. Cool! Python was summoned in the shell. However my calc.py file still didn't work. This time the [Python FAQ's](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html) helped and I sorted out the file address.  I moved the py-programs and web-projects folders from the desktop to the users folder and cd'd to py-programs.

Note! The prompt ruby is a nice little tip about lessons origins of [Learn to program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) adapted for Python from Ruby.

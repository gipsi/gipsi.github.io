### Day 2 March 9th 2018 - Griddy Up

After a quick review of last year's coding efforts I decided that I need to improve my CSS skills.  So today I started  
[CSS GRID](https://cssgrid.io/) the 25 video free course by [Wes Bos ](http://wesbos.com/).

>Wes, How is this Free!? What's the Catch?

>No catch! A huge thanks to Mozilla Firefox who has sponsored my time to create this course and offer it up for free. Firefox packs >some of the best dev tools and in particular their CSS Grid Dev tools make understanding, debugging and visualizing complex grid >layouts a snap.

After the welcome video the first tutorial video **Starter Files and Tooling Setup** is only a little over 10 minutes, but there is a lot to do!
- Install Firefox Quantum: Developer Edition
- Download and install Node.js
- Download starter files from GitHub
- Download and install VS Code

I already have the Firefox Quantum Developer Browser but I did need to install Node.js.  I followed along with the video pausing it to get through each of the steps required complete the setup.  I used Windows Powershell to check for the Node.js installation. Next was downloading the starter files from GitHub, I also forked the repo, noting that I should take care not to do a pull request. 

I got VS code up and running and read the opened JSON lock file.  Although this seemed a bit obscure to start with the reason is to have the```"browser-sync"``` tool update the results of coding in the browser without refreshing.

The next part was to look at the start file package in Powershell by copy pasting it into the root and then ```npm i``` which installed the dependency  ```"browser-sync"```.

```npm start``` then opened a page of the files to work with in the browser.

- A nice basic html skeleton file.
With a demonstration of how adjustments automatically refresh.
- An explanatory recommendation and demonstration of Emmet.
```container.item*10``` is a useful snippet. Hit tab = ten divs.
- A run through of the basic CSS stylesheet no CSS Grid here yet.
- ```var(--color)```from ```:root``` top of stylesheet
- Google ```"box-sizing: border-box;"``` 

Loads of tips and snippets in a short video so I'm happy.  Everything worked not exactly straight away but eventually so looking forward to tomorrow.




                                                                                                                  
### Day 1 March 8th 2018 - Mastering Markdown

Last year I coded every day, nearly four rounds of one hundred days of code. As well as tweeting my progress I followed tutorials, got stuck, found answers, read manuals, read code, read blogs, signed up for email newsletters, did MOOCs ... and made this 
website of my own [gipsi.itbit.me blog](http://gipsi.itbit.me).

Today I'm reviewing what I did, tinkering a bit, fixing broken links and setting up some new things for a another round of [#100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com/).

I'm participating in the CodeNewbie Challenge [**Start Coding** #CNC2018](http://2018.codenewbie.org/) which is encouraging me to think more clearly about and be more specific with my coding goals.

### Day 1 February 1st 2018 - delayed start

Partly due to working on:
- Learning about [Biodiversity and Global Change: Science & Action](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-biodiversity-and-global-change-science-action-7793) and creative writing [The Craft of Plot](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-creative-writing-the-craft-of-plot-5625).
- Setting up the tools for [Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps](https://www.mooc-list.com/course/creative-programming-digital-media-mobile-apps-coursera).
- "Doing the Opposite" [#100DaysOfVolunteering](gipsi.github.io/snowtrees_20180227.jpg) as a thing after thinking about [#100DaysOfX](http://www.100daysofx.com/).
- A MOOC about mental health and wellbeing [Psychology and Mental Health: Beyond Nature and Nurture](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mental-health-and-well-being).

Some styling on the neocities website, nearly changed my mind about the colour. Read about colour schemes and stuff. 

Started with [A11Y Styleguide](http://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-cards.html) then added [Ground Floor](https://gipsi.neocities.org/code/fractal.html) to fractal.html page.

Today I coded a sprite and put it up on the website. [Nervous sprite](https://gipsi.neocities.org/code/fractal.html)  
Tinkered around with color gradient, buttons various CSS.  The editor in neocities gives lots of little warning signs which I went through correcting then, because it changes the way things look I went back through changing the way stuff looks again (e.g. it made the moon button huge).

I only realised that the fractal page I did yesterday was keyboard only navigation after doing it ... then long time reading about how to make a touchscreen navigation.  Google classroom, lots of frameworks, responsive and adaptive design **mobile first**.

### 16/10/2018 100DaysofCode Day 7

After exploring some of the other websites at neocities I saw a [free comments box](https:/.www.freecommentscript.com/) script and had a play with that, trying to figure out whether and what type of HTML tag it should go inside. After reading this blogpost on [Accessibility Landmarks](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html) with this [demo](https://scottaohara.github.io/landmarks_demo/) page by Scott O'Hara I used a form tag.  

Added some titles to the buttons so a another box comes up to say what they are on hover.

Played a bit with [p5.js Web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) in Firefox browser.

Went down a rabbit hole of what the rss button does - and found Firefox is removing it December 2018.

Updated my new website project with a CSS animated [moon button](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/GYOQNY) coded by Chris Coyier.  I tried it out with the version I keep on desktop before uploading to neocities.  Also read a some of Rune Madsen's [Programming Design Systems](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/) and [Hello Processing](https://hello.processing.org/) Hour of Code.

Hacktoberfest: open source [My 6 contributions](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/gipsi)
Looked at quite a few repos to see what might be useful.  Yesterday I went through about 8 Hugo blog tutorials thinking Of contributing to a website, then decided that was a bit ambitious. So stuck to things I understand.  Like typos, spelling and whitespace.  My confidence in reading and understanding what code is is growing quicker than the writing of it.
